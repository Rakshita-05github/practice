<p>Technology is the application of knowledge for achieving practical goals in a reproducible way. The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts, including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software.
    In that, we are going to completely focus on full stack web development and it is exclusively for the students who are exploring and got more interest to learn about this.This camp would be a greater opportunity to learn and explore more on this domain. We will be very happy to
    be a part of your journey as a aspiring developer. We promise you that it will be of a great use.

<li>FRONTEND<p>Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.</p></li>
<li>BACKEND<p>
    Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.
</p></li>
<li>DATABASE<p>
    A database is nothing but an organized collection of data that helps us, whether creating or modifying any program. Some examples of this kind of organization are the bookshelf, the NAS storage, and even databases on your desktop computers!
